# Step 8 - Show Model Trajectory
[Example Ball Trajectory Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t3KB5M0vt2GyOXPKkXG0Gr7wnQNK5sFI/view?usp=sharing) \
With a video and its predictions, we can overlay the predictions onto the video and show the ball's trajectory.

NOTE: This does NOT require a GPU.

## Step 8.1
Make sure you do Step 7.1

## Step 8.2
Change the 'vids' variable in the 2nd code cell.

## Step 8.3
Change the 'versions' variable in the 2nd-to-last code cell. This allows you to see the trajecctory on one or two sets of weights.

## Step 8.3
Run all cells from start to finish. The jupyter notebook should output a .mp4 of the ball's trajectory for each combination of video and model weights.
